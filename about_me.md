hello and welcome to my little page of foraging adventures, identification and exploration. this website is my own journey to safely identify wild edible plants, mushrooms and share with you my growing experiences in foraging.

  
## background
i live in a little town in the south west, UK. the west coast is dominant with scenic coastline of gorse, bramble and heather. there are vast stone beaches, sharp cliff edges neighbouring the bleak expanse of the atlantic ocean. inland a variety of vast pastures, grasslands, the daunting eye of mountainous moorland, and various woodlands habitats. the main areas and sources of foraging are from two working forests; on my doorstep is a coniferous woodland of pine, spruce and beech surrounded by boggy fields, the other is a mixed woodland with varying density of trees and shrubbery. however i do venture to other woodland, moorland and grassland settings to ensure i experience a wider foraging range.

i have always been in love with the idea of being a self-sufficient, woodland creature living off the land and never made any effort to make it a reality. my interest started in october 2021, during our usual weekend walk down to the woods and suddenly stood witness to a sea of fungi on the forest floor instead of pine needles which got me very excited. as of september 2022, i made it a goal to learn those fungi, join foraging pages, groups, created an instagram account to hear from more experienced fungi lovers and start making the effort to be that cottagecore vision.


## what to expect?
my primary goal is to enjoy the simplistic and wholesome act of foraging for food, materials and re-establish a long forgotten connection to the land. it is a novice account so mistakes will be made, noted and growth will happen from them. 

from this website, there will be hand-drawn pictures, how to cook, prepare and preserve, foraging tips, an identification table of plants, fungi and a terminology index. i hope you all enjoy and don't munch on a hunch.
