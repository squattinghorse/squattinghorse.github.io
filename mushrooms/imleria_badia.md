the bay bolete (*imleria badia* or previously known as *boletus badia*) is a fairly widespread edible mushroom and a good novice mushroom for identification. they tend to grow on the ground or decaying tree stumps, more commonly found in coniferous woodland. so far, i have found them growing in my local coniferous forests, under pine, spruce and some beech trees, however they can be seen to grow under deciduous broadleaf trees as well. 

the bay bolete is one of the first mushrooms i saw and recorded in early october 2022. this was a time when i was just excited to see a mushroom, let alone taste it. i took many pictures of the large groups of beautiful boletes standing tall and untouched, of which now i look back with all sorts of envy at how many great dishes i could have made with them. 

as mentioned before, they are a very easy mushroom to identify as a novice forager. their characteristics can't be mistaken for anything poisonous and the closest looking bolete relative is the widely popular *boletus edulis* (penny bun, cep, porcini). according to some resources it is inferior in taste to the penny bun, but i think i'll make that decision when i taste it. 

## characteristics

### cap
the cap is often convex and will flatten when more mature. it has a smooth dark, 'bay' brown cap - referring to its chestnut colour. in some of the pictures above, the cap looks slimy and that can occur when it becomes wet

### pores
the pores on the underside of the cap can be cream to pale yellow, but change and stain to a light blue/ olive green when bruised. the pores are large and circular and become angular when more mature

### stem
one of the more defining features is the stem, which is a pale brown. the stem has a net pattern of brown ridges going vertically down the stem on a pale background

### flesh
the flesh is white/pale yellow which will also stain pale blue/ olive green when cut or bruised. there is a beginners rule to follow, “red and blue makes you spew”. this translates as avoid any boletes with red on the stem, pores or cap and any bolete whose flesh turns rapidly blue when cut. it does mean you might miss out on some wonderful bolete edibles but it will mean you are 100% safe

### spore print
spore print is green/brown

### interesting information
they are a particularly good fine as they have the advantage of being less frequently infested with maggots

they are more abundant in the late summer and throughout the autumn (july-november) and i had just plucked the courage up to eat wild mushrooms when the season had ended. this year i can proudly say i will be trying the bay bolete and hopefully can make some very tasty food with them too.
